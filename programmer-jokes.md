"I am the most powerful genie in the world. I will grant you one and only one wish." The rogrammer thinks, pulls out a map, and says, "I'd like there to be a just and last peace among the people in the Middle East."
The genie responded, "Wow, that's a tall order. I don't know if I can do that. I mean, I'm powerful and all, but I'm not that powerful. So, the programmer says, "Well, I'm a developer, and my programs have a lot of users. Make my users satisfied with my programs and make them ask for sensible changes." The genie nods, "Let me see that map again."
